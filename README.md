# Create a Criminal
### Single Page API (SPA) website created and coded by Chhaian Pin

## Premise
Sample website that allows Seattle police officers to assist city prosecutors to file criminal charges based on police reports collected from Seattle Police Department's Police Report API.

Create a Criminal features crime searches based on date and criminal type. Allows prosecutors to view reported crimes and the neighborhood that the crime was committed. Based on the results generated, prosecutors have the option to file charges.

When charges are filed, a view pane displays a randomly generated mugshot and a form that allows creation of a case file. Cases that are created are stored in the SPA's database.

Created criminal cases are searchable and viewable.

Cases that are scheduled for future court dates can be viewed and selected from a table.

## Use cases
* Find created criminal cases in database
* View court date session that has cases scheduled
* Get police reports filed on specific dates
* Filter police reports by crime and date
* Create criminal case files based on results generated
* Update case files with specific case information or docket entries

## Video Demo

## Future Features
* Create a model in the backend that stores each criminal's information
* Criminals can have multiple cases
* Criminals can have multiple hearings
* Criminals can be charged with multiple charges from the same occurrence

## Project status
Currently a minimal viable product and sample demo.
